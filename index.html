          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>Debugging is one of the most important parts of the development process. Because you only really understand the code while you are writing it, it's really important to leave comments for yourself to be able to review later if/when a bug or issue were to arise. Using GitHub Co-Pilot can really help with learning to write good comments and documentation
          <li>You don't need to document each bug fix, except for in GitHub where you can use git commit when you fix a bug</li>
          <li>External CSS Style sheet preferred in most cases because it allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file, which makes design changes easier.</li>
          <li>Conversely, Internal style sheet's contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file, which apply to that page </li>
          <li>Separation of concerns is a widely used term in web development and refers to separating code into different files based on use.</li>
